# git-tests
This repo is used to learn to use Git with GitHub with some tests.

This repo was initialized with this README, which, apparently, created it with an initial commit in the 'main' branch. Now, trying to hook it up with a local repo that also had an initial commit, using `$ git remote add origin <clone URL>` and `$ git push -u origin master`, it ended up showing a message that said that changes were made to 'master' branch and an option to `Compare & pull request`. However, choosing that option syas thereis nothing to compare and that the two branches are entierly different commit histories. Also, going to 'Network' in 'Insights' shows two dots representing the branches with no relation between them at all. So, this is most likely not the correct way to do it.
